					<p>As described on the homepage, I’m Hend and I love being around people. Sharing experiences and telling stories is something I really admire.  To me it’s important to get to know the person better, so that it’s easier to comfort them. I strongly believe in achieving more by listening to others and trying to understand this by doing a (little) research. My ultimate goal is to travel the world to learn about different cultures and habits. It would be wonderful if I could use this information to step up the user experience of a website. </p>

			        		<p> The first time I touched a computer was when I was 6 years old. I discovered the internet when I was 7 and got introduced to Paint, Space Cadet and Minesweeper (which I still don’t understand) when there was no internet connection... Every time I got my hands on the computer, I knew I was going to have a great time. The internet was a world full of surprises and possibilities. I remember those days where I used to write little codes on Neopets, things as changing the background colour or resizing text. The site went down and it all stopped for me. Coding reminds me of math, the structure and the possibilities amaze me. Luckily I got my hands on it again and I’m trying get better every day. I’m really interested in the world of coding, the possibilities seem to be endless and with a touch of creativity it all gets more wonderful. </p>

						<p>Isn’t it interesting how the same company can have a different layouts based on the cultural differences between the audience? Before starting my journey, this aspect never came to my mind. Since I’ve got introduced to this, I got interested in the way designers use different patterns. We want great user experience and the best way to achieve this, is to understand the target audience. The key to achieve the best information, is to stay open for the input. A user friendly website is made out of the right patterns and a creative touch.</p>

						<p>My aspiration is to travel the world and to learn about the differences between cultures. I believe in understanding people better by listening and to try new things. You’ve got to ask yourself the same question over and over again: why? This allows you to dig deeper and to find the right solutions to the giving problem.</p>
